# Dynamic-Programming-Airline-Revenue
Airline Booking Revenue Optimization using Dynamic Programming

This project aims to help an airline company maximize its revenue through dynamic pricing and overbooking strategies.

The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the optimal prices for first-class and coach tickets on a daily basis, based on the company's overbooking policy and expected profit.

Two different strategies are explored: a hard cutoff point for the number of overbooked tickets, and a dynamic overbooking policy that allows the airline to stop selling tickets to optimize the number of overbooked passengers.

The program also takes into account the cost of upgrading coach customers to first class and the cost of offering vouchers to overbooked customers.
